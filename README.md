# Flappy-Bird-by-Reinforcement-Learning

Despite the application in daily life technologies, learning to play games also became a popular research topic in artificial intelligence field since game is one of main entertainments and the commercial profits behind the whole game industry cannot be ignored. The game we are working on in this paper is the Flappy Bird game, a simple but popular mobile game released in 2013. The main task for users in this game is to control a bird going through a bunch of obstacles like pipes. Build on the general framework implementing both Reinforcement Learning and Convolutional Neural Network, we added real-human inputs as the training data to help accelerate the training process. The experiment results showed that our proposed model improved the performance in both accuracy and human-like level. Furthermore, our learning model would also be applied to other AI tasks involving human factors in cyber physical systems.
